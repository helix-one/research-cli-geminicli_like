The processes by which an organism develops its shape and heals wounds involve expansion of a monolayer sheet of cells. The mechanism underpinning this epithelial expansion remains obscure, despite the fact that its failure is known to contribute to several diseases, including carcinomas, which account for about 90% of all human cancers. Here, using the micropatterned epithelial monolayer as a model system, we report the discovery of a mechanical wave that propagates slowly to span the monolayer, traverses intercellular junctions in a cooperative manner and builds up differentials of mechanical stress. Essential features of this wave generation and propagation are captured by a minimal model based on sequential fronts of cytoskeletal reinforcement and fluidization. These findings establish a mechanism of long-range cell guidance, symmetry breaking and pattern formation during monolayer expansion.

Epithelial monolayer expansion is increasingly regarded as a mechanical phenomenon in which physical forces not only drive cell motions but also trigger and feedback to signalling pathways \( {}^{1 - 3} \) . Each cell in the sheet is now known to generate forces on its underlying substrate \( {}^{1} \) , to transmit forces through intercellular junctions so as to create long-ranged gradients of tension \( {}^{4} \) , and to migrate preferentially along the direction of maximum principal stress \( {}^{5} \) . Despite such recent discoveries, the ultraslow dynamics of epithelial expansion remain poorly understood.

To study such dynamics, we developed an experimental approach that combines soft lithography \( {}^{6,7} \) , traction force microscopy \( {}^{4} \) and monolayer stress microscopy \( {}^{5} \) . A polydimethyl-siloxane (PDMS) membrane was fabricated with a rectangular opening and deposited on a polyacrylamide gel that had been coated with collagen I. We then seeded Madin-Darby Canine Kidney (MDCK) epithelial cells and allowed them to adhere and proliferate (Fig. 1a). On reaching confluence and a relatively high cell density, the monolayer sheet exhibited features typical of a stable epithelium including apico-basal polarity and accumulation of cortical actin at cell-cell junctions (Fig. 1b, c). Moreover, the tight junction protein ZO-1 (zona occludens 1) and the adherens junction protein E-cadherin co-localized at the lateral membranes of the cells (Fig. 1c).

Sudden removal of the PDMS membrane triggered collective cellular migration towards newly available free space (Figs 1a-c, 2a-c and Supplementary Movie S1). Over the course of \( {600}\mathrm{\;{min}} \) , the total area of the monolayer sheet more than doubled, with less than half of the total area being attributable to proliferation (Fig. 1d inset) and the rest being attributable to cell spreading and flattening (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Text S2). In this process, the actin cytoskeleton exhibited a pronounced reorganization; it formed protrusions and transverse stress fibres in cells both at the leading edge and well behind it (Fig. 1c and Supplementary Movie S2). These changes in actin organization were paralleled by pronounced changes in the size and shape of focal adhesions (Fig. 1c). Cells did not undergo a full transition to a mesenchymal state, however; although E-cadherin was partially internalized, tight junctions remained intact and the monolayer expanded as a cohesive unit (Fig. 1c). Moreover, whereas a number of genes traditionally associated with the epithelial to mesenchymal transition such as those encoding paxillin, vinculin and \( \beta \) -actin exhibited changes in expression, others such as those encoding E-cadherin, vimentin and ZO-1 did not (Supplementary Fig. S1).

The internal dynamics of the monolayer were remarkable, both in terms of the distribution of cellular velocities and underlying tractions exerted by each cell on its substrate. Shortly after removal of the PDMS stencil, migration outwards was limited to cells at the leading edge (Fig. 2d), whereas cells back from the leading edge remained virtually immobile. With increasing time, however, cell movement penetrated progressively deeper into the monolayer and gave rise to a pattern of velocities characterized by an outer boundary layer of outward velocities at the edges and an inner region of negligible velocities at the centre (Fig. 2e). A similar evolution of cellular velocities was recently reported after monolayer wounding, thus supporting the notion that progressive cell mobilization away from the leading edge is a general response of cell collectives to the release of physical boundaries \( {}^{8} \) . Traction forces exerted by cells on the underlying substrate exhibited similar spatial organization, with boundary layers of large tractions at both edges and virtually no traction at the centre. Fluctuations of both velocities and tractions increased with time and progressively expanded towards the monolayer midline (Fig. 2f, i).

If each cell in the monolayer has the capability to exert tractions on its substrate across focal or fibrillar adhesions, it also has the capability to exert stresses on its immediate neighbours across cell-cell junctions \( {}^{5,9,{10}} \) . Using monolayer stress microscopy \( {}^{5} \) (Methods and Supplementary Texts S1 and S2), we measured corresponding inter- and intra-cellular stresses, which we refer to together simply as monolayer stresses. Shortly after the stencil was lifted, the average normal stress \( \left( \bar{\sigma }\right) \) was largely tensile (positive) but was restricted to thin boundary layers at the leading edges, whereas the centre of the monolayer remained relaxed (Fig. 2j).

Figure 1 | Experimental model. a, A PDMS membrane is deposited on a collagen-coated polyacrylamide (PA) gel. Cells are seeded and allowed to attach only over the gap defined by the PDMS membrane. When confluent cells reach a relatively high confluence, the PDMS membrane is peeled off and cells start invading the surrounding space. \( \mathbf{b} \) , Transversal view of LifeAct MDCK cells at the specified time points after the PDMS membrane was removed; scale bar, \( {20\mu }\mathrm{m}.\mathbf{c} \) , Basal actin (LifeAct-GFP), E-cadherin, ZO-1 and paxillin immunofluorescence micrographs before, \( 1\mathrm{\;h} \) after and \( 4\mathrm{\;h} \) after removing the membranes. Scale bars, \( {15\mu }\mathrm{m}.\mathbf{d} \) , Cell sheet area (filled circles) and cell sheet area due to proliferation (white circles) at different time points. The area due to proliferation was calculated by counting the number of cells in the monolayer at distinct time points and then multiplying the number of new cells by the average cell area. Data are mean \( \pm \) s.d. \( \left( {n = 5}\right) \) . Inset: relative contribution of cell proliferation to cell sheet area.

With time, these boundary layers became markedly heterogeneous but systematically grew to encompass increasing numbers of cells; cell-cell tension transmission exhibited a growing scale of length (Fig. 2k), and the maximum intercellular shear stress \( \left( \bar{\mu }\right) \) followed a similar pattern (Fig. 2m, n). Taken together, these findings demonstrate that force transmission from cell-to-cell, and cellular migration across the epithelial sheet, are initiated at the leading edge and progressively penetrate towards the centre (Supplementary Movie S3).

Moreover, these stress fields were anisotropic. At each position in the monolayer plane, the maximum \( \left( {\sigma }_{\max }\right) \) and minimum \( \left( {\sigma }_{\min }\right) \) principal stresses \( {}^{5} \) were represented as an ellipse aligned with corresponding principal orientations (Fig. 2p). Throughout epithelial expansion, stress ellipses tended to be spindle-shaped and thus revealed pronounced stress anisotropy. The maximum principal stress orientation tended to be perpendicular to the leading edge and thus roughly parallel to local cell motion (Fig. 2q). As described previously, this mode of local cell guidance defines plithotaxis \( {}^{2,5} \) .

Superposed on systematic monolayer spreading were large-scale spatio-temporal fluctuations of tractions, monolayer stresses and cellular velocities (Fig. 2f, i, l, o). To better characterize the systematic evolution of mechanical patterns, we averaged these variables over the observable monolayer length (corresponding to the \( y \) coordinate), thereby reducing the dimensionality of the system to only one spatial dimension and one temporal dimension. All data could then be represented as kymographs in the \( x - t \) plane (Methods). Kymographs of cellular velocity \( \left( {v}_{x}\right) \) revealed motility patterns that were not restricted to the initial phase of inward mobilization (Fig. 3a). To the contrary, after reaching the monolayer midline at \( \sim  {150}\mathrm{\;{min}} \) , the two fronts of cell motility coalesced and then continued towards the leading edges. When cells are cohesive and mass is conserved, cellular velocities must be linked to the rate of cell deformation (strain rate, \( {\dot{\varepsilon }}_{xx} \) ; ref. 11) through the expression \( {\dot{\varepsilon }}_{xx} = \partial {v}_{x}/\partial x \) . Remarkably, kymographs of \( {\dot{\varepsilon }}_{xx} \) revealed clear evidence of wave-like crests of strain rate that were launched at each leading edge, propagated away from and back to the leading edge at roughly twice the speed of the advancing front edge, and spanned the entire monolayer (Fig. 3b). To distinguish these mechanical waves from other known types of mechanical wave, and because they inscribe an X-shape on the kymograph, we call them X-waves.

To study the physical origin of the X-wave, we next focused on traction generation and stress transmission in the monolayer. Whereas traction kymographs demonstrated extrema at the leading edge, monolayer stresses were highest at the monolayer midline, indicating that local force generation was globally integrated and transmitted through cell-cell junctions to give rise to a stress build-up (Fig. 3c, d). Importantly, monolayer stress at the midline oscillated in time (Fig. 3g, h and Supplementary Movie S4); these oscillations were in phase with fluctuations of cell area (Fig. 3f, h) and demonstrated phase quadrature with strain rate (Fig. 3e). Contrary to long-held assumptions (reviewed in ref. 12), these observations establish that on the ultraslow timescales of cellular migration the dominant cellular stresses in the monolayer are elastic, not viscous.

In the absence of appreciable inertia, there can exist no exchange between kinetic and potential energy storage as is usually associated with propagation of passive mechanical waves, thus suggesting that the mechanism underlying the observed propagation might be active. To investigate this possibility, we inhibited myosin using blebbistatin. Blebbistatin prevented the formation of stress fibres (Supplementary Fig. S2) and had little effect on the velocity of the leading edge, thus confirming previous reports in wound scratch \( {\text{assays}}^{8} \) . Blebbistatin caused traction forces and intercellular stresses to be abrogated, however (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Movie S5). A well-defined front of strain rate could be clearly identified nonetheless, but this front was stationary, did not propagate and dispersed or attenuated after about \( {450}\mathrm{\;{min}} \) . Together, these findings indicate that the propagating mechanical wave involves a contractile component.

To study the role of intercellular adhesion in monolayer stress transmission and wave propagation, we disrupted cell-cell junctions by chelation of extracellular calcium \( {}^{5} \) after \( {280}\mathrm{\;{min}} \) of monolayer expansion (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Movie S6). Within \( {20}\mathrm{\;{min}} \) of calcium chelation, the monolayer lost its structural integrity and isolated cells were seen to escape from the leading edge. Monolayer stress exhibited a sharp drop and wave crests vanished (Supplementary Fig. S3). Restoration of calcium levels 45 min later rescued monolayer stresses and wave propagation but, remarkably, wave propagation restarted at the very edge the monolayer. These data highlight a central role for cell-cell junctions in the generation and propagation of X-waves. They show, further, that these waves are not restricted to the case of sudden release of a physical constraint.

Across experiments, monolayer expansion exhibited various levels of symmetry breaking (Supplementary Fig. S4). As in the symmetric case (Fig. 3), experiments in which symmetry was spontaneously broken showed propagation of velocity fronts back from each leading edge but, on collision, one of the two fronts penetrated past the midline into the opposite side of the monolayer before propagating back towards the leading edge (Supplementary Fig. S4a, b). As such, the characteristic time for the velocity front to complete one cycle of inward and outward propagation was longer than in the symmetric case. Symmetry breaking in multicellular systems is a widespread process that remains poorly understood \( {}^{{13} - {15}} \) . Our findings suggest that symmetry breaking during monolayer expansion originates at the very edge of the monolayer boundaries at the very onset of migration (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Movie S7), with the highest stresses restricted to the first few rows of the fastest leading edge.

Waves in chemical systems, as in the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, rely on temporal competition between reaction times and diffusion times, and a generalization of this idea to nonequilibrium mechano-chemical systems was recently proposed \( {}^{16} \) . Alternatively, wave propagation can also originate from threshold phenomena that are rapid, coupled with refractory phenomena that are slow, as in propagation of the action potential \( {}^{17} \) . Although it remains unclear how comparable mechanisms might account for the mechanical waves reported here, a minimal one-dimensional mechanical model captures the observed phenomenology without invoking chemical factors or their associated reaction, diffusion and advection. The model treats the monolayer as a collection of springs (cells) of elastic constant \( k \) connected in series (Fig. 4a). Each cell is allowed to generate a self-propelling force \( {\mathbf{F}}_{i} \) . This propelling force can be transmitted through elastic forces to neighbouring cells and by frictional forces to the underlying gel substrate. The position \( {x}_{i} \) of a generic node (cell-cell junction) is affected by the force \( {\mathbf{F}}_{i} \) , by the elastic responses \( {\mathbf{f}}_{i}^{\mathrm{e}} \) and \( {\mathbf{f}}_{i + 1}^{\mathrm{e}} \) of the two cells joined at that node, and by the viscous friction \( {\mathbf{f}}_{i} \) between those two cells and the gel substrate (Fig. 4b), represented as a dashpot of constant viscosity \( \eta \) (Fig. 4a). Thus, force balance at each node \( {x}_{i} \) reads

\[
{F}_{i} + k{\varepsilon }_{i} - k{\varepsilon }_{i + 1} - \eta {\dot{x}}_{i} = 0
\]

where \( {\varepsilon }_{i} \) denotes the strain undergone by the spring connecting nodes \( {x}_{i - 1} \) and \( {x}_{i} \) , and \( {\dot{x}}_{i} \) denotes the velocity of node \( {x}_{i} \) .

In the context of this model we first considered the two most widely invoked mechanisms for monolayer expansion, namely, that force generation is restricted to the first few leading cell rows, or that each cell in the monolayer is mechanically self-propelled. Simulation of each of these scenarios results in monolayer expansion but fails to account for the generation and propagation of X-waves (Supplementary Text S3). In contrast, such waves are captured with only two assumptions. The first is that a cell acquires a motile phenotype only when an adjacent cell either creates space \( {}^{18} \) or pulls on the shared intercellular junction \( {}^{19} \) , either of which would promote local cell unjamming \( {}^{5,{20},{21}} \) and lead naturally to the propagation of a strain-rate front followed by a stress build-up (Supplementary Text S3). If, second, the cell is assumed to possess a threshold of strain beyond which the cytoskeleton first reinforces \( {}^{22} \) but then fluidizes \( {}^{23} \) , then strain rate fronts and stress differentials become reiterated in time. As they elicit effects on cellular mechanical properties that are nonlinear in character but opposite in sign, and, importantly, as they act over disparate scales of time \( {}^{{23},{24}} \) , reinforcement and fluidization taken together are shown to be sufficient to sustain a propagating mechanical wave with many of the same features as the X-waves demonstrated experimentally (Fig. 4d-f and Supplementary Movie S8). A role for reaction-diffusion-advection mechanisms or for gene oscillators cannot be ruled out, but to explain these mechanical waves, such mechanisms need not be invoked.

In view of this relationship, pattern formation during development is widely attributed to cellular sensing of local chemical differentials that become reiterated over the span of a great many cells. Although there is little doubt that such reiterated chemical differentials are necessary to explain patterning, it remains unclear whether they are sufficient. For example, large multicellular systems are typically heterogeneous, dynamic and noisy. In such systems, can the reaction, diffusion and advection of chemical factors act with sufficient precision to transmit requisite information over distances spanning a great many cells? This question and others have led to the hypothesis that pattern formation requires another feedback mechanism, and that such a mechanism is provided by physical forces \( {}^{2,{16},{25} - {28}} \) . It is now well established that local physical forces can be transduced into local intracellular signals to activate local regulatory protein networks \( {}^{{29} - {32}} \) , but patterns of stress and strain reiterated in time and over space across a multicellular tissue have never before been observed. Our finding of a slow mechanical wave constitutes the first direct evidence of such reiterated mechanical patterns and thus provides a natural candidate to trigger mechanotransduction pathways during wound healing, morphogenesis and collective cellular invasion in cancer.

## Methods

Cell culture. MDCK strain II cells were cultured in minimum essential media with Earle's Salts and L-glutamine (Gibco) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco), \( {100}\mathrm{U}{\mathrm{{ml}}}^{-1} \) penicillin and \( {100\mu }\mathrm{g}{\mathrm{{ml}}}^{-1} \) streptomycin.

Microfabrication of the PDMS membranes. PDMS membranes were fabricated according to procedures described previously \( {}^{7,{33}} \) . Briefly, SU8-50 masters containing rectangles of \( {300} \times  2,{500\mu }\mathrm{m} \) were raised using conventional photolithography. Uncured PDMS was spin-coated on the masters to a thickness lower than the height of the SU8 feature \( \left( {{35\mu }\mathrm{m}}\right) \) and cured for \( 2\mathrm{\;h} \) at \( {60}^{ \circ  }\mathrm{C} \) . A thicker border of PDMS was applied at the edges of the membranes for handling purposes. PDMS was then peeled off from the master and kept in ethanol at \( {4}^{ \circ  }\mathrm{C} \) until use.

Preparation of polyacrylamide gels. Polyacrylamide gel preparation was adapted from protocols described in refs 34,35. Glass-bottom dishes were activated by using a 1:1:14 solution of acetic acid/bind-silane/ethanol. The dishes were washed twice with ethanol and air-dried for \( {10}\mathrm{\;{min}} \) . For \( 3\mathrm{{kPa}} \) gels, a stock solution containing a concentration of 5.5% acrylamide, 0.09% bisacrylamide, 0.5% ammonium persulphate, 0.05% tetramethylethylenediamine, 0.4% of 200-nm-diameter red fluorescent carboxylate-modified beads (Fluospheres, Invitrogen) and \( 2\mathrm{{mg}}{\mathrm{{ml}}}^{-1} \) \( \mathrm{{NH}} \) -acrylate was prepared. A drop of \( {10\mu }\mathrm{l} \) was added to the centre of the glass-bottom dishes, and the solution was covered with 12-mm-diameter glass coverslips. After polymerization, gels were washed with PBS and incubated with \( {100\mu }\mathrm{l} \) of a collagen I solution \( \left( {{0.1}\mathrm{{mg}}{\mathrm{{ml}}}^{-1}}\right. \) , Millipore) overnight at \( {4}^{ \circ  }\mathrm{C} \) . Gels were washed afterwards with PBS and incubated with cell culture media with \( {10}\% \) FBS for \( 6\mathrm{\;h} \) .

Cell patterning on soft substrates. One hour before seeding the cells, the PDMS membranes were air dried and incubated in a solution of 2% Pluronic F-127 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS to avoid damage of the gel coating due to the PDMS membrane. The membranes were then washed twice with PBS and air dried for \( {20}\mathrm{\;{min}} \) , and they were deposited on the surface of the polyacrylamide gel. A small volume ( \( {8\mu }\mathrm{l} \) ) containing 15,000 cells was placed on the exposed region of the polyacrylamide gel defined by the PDMS membrane. Once the cells were attached to the polyacrylamide gel(20min), the unattached cells were washed away and \( {200\mu }\mathrm{l} \) of medium was added. Twelve hours after seeding the cells, \( 2\mathrm{{ml}} \) of medium was added and the PDMS membranes were carefully removed with tweezers before the beginning of the experiment.

Time-lapse microscopy. Multidimensional acquisition routines were performed on an automated inverted microscope (Nikon Eclipse Ti) equipped with thermal, \( {\mathrm{{CO}}}_{2} \) and humidity control, using MetaMorph (Universal Imaging) software. Time-lapse recording started approximately \( {30}\mathrm{\;{min}} \) after removing the PDMS membrane. The interval between image acquisition was \( 1\mathrm{\;{min}} \) and a typical experiment lasted for \( {20}\mathrm{\;h} \) . To capture the full width of the expanding cell sheet, two images were acquired at \( \times  {10} \) for every time point, approximately overlapping laterally by 10%. The two images were accurately stitched with subpixel resolution using custom-made MatLab software.

Fluorescence microscopy. Immunofluorescence microscopy experiments were carried out by fixing the cells with 3% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS, permeabilizing with 0.5% Triton X-100 (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS, and blocking with 10% FBS (Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS.

Primary antibodies mouse anti-E-cadherin (BD Transduction Laboratories), rabbit anti-ZO-1 (Zymed, Invitrogen) and mouse anti-paxillin (BD Transduction Laboratories) diluted at 1:1,000, 1:500 and 1:100, respectively, in 10% FBS in PBS were incubated for \( 1\mathrm{\;h} \) at room temperature, and were detected using secondary antibodies goat anti-mouse and donkey anti-rabbit (Invitrogen). A spectral confocal microscope (Nikon Eclipse C1si) was used for high-resolution image acquisition.

Cell area measurements. The contour of each cell was determined using a segmentation algorithm (Greylevel Watershed for ImageJ, D. Sage, Biomedical Image Group, EPFL). Phase-contrast images were pre-processed by contrast enhancement followed by a Gaussian blur. To limit the over-sampling inherent to water-shedding algorithms, we set up the appropriate limits for the cell area and eccentricity.

Velocity measurements. Velocity fields were computed using custom-made particle image velocimetry software on the phase-contrast images. The interrogation window was either \( {64} \times  {64} \) pixels or \( {96} \times  {96} \) pixels, and the time interval between consecutive analysed images was \( 1\mathrm{\;{min}} \) . Monolayer boundaries were computed using a home-made algorithm based on the standard deviation of each interrogation window in the phase-contrast images.

Traction microscopy. Traction forces were computed using Fourier transform traction microscopy with a finite gel thickness \( {}^{4} \) . Gel displacements between any experimental time point and a reference image obtained after monolayer trypsinization were computed using home-made particle imaging velocimetry software. To reduce systematic biases in subpixel resolution and peak-locking effects, we implemented an iterative process ( \( n = 4 \) iterations) based on a continuous window shift technique.

Monolayer stress microscopy. Monolayer stresses were computed using monolayer stress microscopy \( {}^{5} \) . Monolayer stress microscopy uses traction forces and straightforward force balance demanded by Newton's laws to map the two-dimensional stress tensor \( \sigma \) in the monolayer:

\[
\sigma  = \left( \begin{array}{ll} {\sigma }_{xx} & {\sigma }_{xy} \\  {\sigma }_{yx} & {\sigma }_{yy} \end{array}\right)
\]

By rotating these stress components at each point in the cell sheet, we computed the magnitude of the two principal stress components \( {\sigma }_{\max } \) and \( {\sigma }_{\min } \) and their corresponding, mutually perpendicular, principal orientations. For each point in the monolayer, we then computed the average normal stress within and between cells defined as \( \bar{\sigma } = \left( {{\sigma }_{\max } + {\sigma }_{\min }}\right) /2 \) and the maximum intercellular shear stress defined as \( \bar{\mu } = \left( {{\sigma }_{\max } - {\sigma }_{\min }}\right) /2 \) .

Kymographs. For each pixel in the monolayer, we computed the distance to the closest leading edge. Next we computed the median values of velocities, tractions, monolayer stresses and strain rates of all pixels located at a given distance from the leading edge. These median values were then represented on a unidimensional segment whose width was the mean width of the monolayer. This operation was repeated for each experimental time point.

Quantification of gene expression. MDCK monolayers were collected at 0 , 3, and \( 7\mathrm{\;h} \) of monolayer expansion. The total RNA was extracted using the PARIS kit (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA was quantified by the absorbance at \( {260}\mathrm{\;{nm}} \) , and reverse transcribed into complementary DNA using the high-capacity RNA-to-cDNA master mix (Applied Biosystems). Quantitative PCR was performed with the 7500 fast real-time PCR system and software (Applied Biosystems). TaqMan gene expression assays Cf02668852_g1, Cf02651495_m1, Cf02628470_m1, Cf02624268_m1, Cf02667774_m1, Cf02645536_m1, and Cf03023880_g1 were used to detect vimentin, paxillin, ZO-1, E-cadherin, \( \beta \) -catenin, vinculin and \( \beta \) -actin, respectively. Quantitative real-time PCR values were normalized to an internal control s18 (TaqMan probe Cf02624915_gl), averaged and expressed relative to gene expression before cell migration(0h).
